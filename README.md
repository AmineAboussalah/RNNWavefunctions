# Recurrent Neural Network Wavefunctions

RNN Wavefunctions are efficient quantum many-body wavefunction ans√§tzes based on Recurrent Neural Networks. These wavefunction can be used to find the ground state of a quantum many-body Hamiltonian using Variational Monte Carlo (VMC). In our recent paper (**arxiv link**), we show that this novel architecture can provide accurate estimations of ground state energies, correlation functions as well as entanglement entropies.

Our implementation is based on TensorFlow 1 and we plan to support TensorFlow 2 and PyTorch in the future.

## Running Variational Monte Carlo (VMC) Calculations

This repository contains the following folders:

### 1DTFIM
1D Positive Recurrent Neural Network Wavefunction for 1D Transverse-field Ising Model (TFIM).
### 2DTFIM_1DRNN
1D Positive Recurrent Neural Network Wavefunction for 2D TFIM.
### 2DTFIM_2DRNN 
2D Positive Recurrent Neural Network Wavefunction for 2D TFIM.
### J1J2
1D Complex Recurrent Neural Network Wavefunction for 1D J1-J2 Model.
### Check_Points
This folder is intended to save the parameters of the RNN wavefunction as well as the energies and the variances after training.
### Tutorials 
This folder contains jupyter notebooks that you can run on Google colaboratory (colab.research.google.com/) to test how RNN wavefunctions

To run a VMC calculation for the task of finding the ground state energy of a certain model, it is enough to execute the python run file in a folder of interest.

We plan to support more models and architectures in the future.
