# RNN Wavefunctions

RNN Wavefunctions are efficient quantum many-body wavefunction ans√§tzes based on Recurrent Neural Networks. In our recent paper, we show that this new architecture can provide accurate estimations of ground state energies, correlation functions as well as entanglement entropies.
